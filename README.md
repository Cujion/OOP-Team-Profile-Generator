## Description
* This application is a Object Oriented Program (OOP) to build a team profile generator, which is designed to use Test Driven Development (TDD) to help structure the program and make sure the program is written correctly and run properly. The application uses class constructor as a base format along with subclasses for adding more team members to your webpage. When the program is ran you will be prompted with managers questions about your employee ID, Email and office number. After answer the questions you will be prompted if you would like to add an engineer and or an intern in which you will be asked another set of questions based on your selected input. Once you have added all your team members a HTML page will be generated in which you can then open that HTML page in a web browser to see your newly generated team displated with the correct corresponding answers to the prompted questions.
